# The basic idea of this program is to build up a quadword (64-bit) number from
# 2 bytes, 1 word and 1 long and then we put that quadword as the exit status.

# We mash together the following numbers into one quadword stored in %rax
# 01010101
# 11101010
# 1011011100110101
# 10101010101010101010101110101011

# We want this in reverse order of what I have shown, so we want to end with
# 1010101010101010101010111010101110110111001101011110101001010101
# which is a very large number; too large to have as an exit code.
# But we simply then do integer division with 2^60, which in binary is
# 0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 and
# that should give us 10 (integer division truncates the decimals).

_start:
   # We start by taking our 32-bit number (that we want to the left) and pad it
   # with 32 zeroes and move that into rax
   movq $0b1010101010101010101010111010101100000000000000000000000000000000, %rax
   # We now pad the 16 bits with 16 zeroes and move it into eax
   movl $0b10110111001101010000000000000000, %eax
   # We now pad 11101010 with 8 zeroes and move it into %ax (we could've just
   # moved it into %ah without padding, but I want an excuse to also use a
   # word (16-bit) instruction)
   movw $0b1110101000000000, %ax
   # We move 01010101 into al
   movb $0b01010101, %al
   # We divide %rax by 2^60 by first storing 2^60 in rbx
   movq $0b0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, %rbx
   divq %rbx

   movq %rax, %rdi
   movq $60, %rax
   syscall

# Okay, so this doesn't produce the desired result. Going through it with the
# debugger, I found out that this happens because the 32-bit move into eax
# zeroes the upper 32 bits that we started by setting in rax. Which, of course,
# ruins the whole thing. Even more peculiarly, this doesn't happen with neither
# the 16-bit register nor with the 8-bit register!

# Looking it up, it indeed seems that all of this weirdness is intentional:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11177137/why-do-x86-64-instructions-on-32-bit-registers-zero-the-upper-part-of-the-full-6

# Technically, this means I didn't really solve this problem, because I did not
# actually come up with something that worked, but I came up with something
# sensible, implemented it, got to go through it with the debugger and finally,
# I got to learn about a very specific quirk of x86-64 assembly. So I feel like
# I got enough out of it that I can consider this problem solved in spirit.
