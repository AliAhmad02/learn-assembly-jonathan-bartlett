# For the position of the cursor, you need to numbers to represent its position
# in x and y. This could, for example be an an array of length 2.
# 
# The pixels need 2 values for the position, in addition to three values for the
# red, green and blue color channels. Thus, we could have an array of pixels
# where each entry is 5 values. Also, these values probaby don't need to be
# quadwords, since the color channels and the position on the screen cannot
# take on super high values.
