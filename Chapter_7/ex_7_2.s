# Well, Hyprland doesn't really have this, but in principle it'd probably be
# a bunch of options, some of which are numbers on a sliding scale and some
# of which are dropdowns, where you can pick a few options (or even 2 options).
# 
# For some of these, you probably need floats, which we haven't really gotten
# to yet. For others, it might just be 2 options. Which could be represented
# with a single bit (i.e. as a boolean). But I'm also not sure how you could do
# that in assembly, since there doesn't seem to be single bit registers.
